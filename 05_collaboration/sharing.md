# Sharing

While having your resources organized in convenient, sometimes you need to share your resources between teams and users. There are three ways to do it. 

### Explore

You can share projects, neural networks and plugins with the whole instance using the Explore section. Choose "Publish" in the context menu to add items to make them accessible for everyone. Users in different teams see the same items on the Explore page. Other users cannot change items in Explore, but can clone them to their current team and workspace.

### Clone

Clone can be used directly without Explore. Choose "Clone to..." in the context menu and select the team to which you want to clone the item. You can only select teams that have you as a member.

### Share as link

To clone an item directly to a team that doesn't have you as a member, create a unique link to share the item. When you open it in another team or workspace, you will see a conformation to clone a particular item.
