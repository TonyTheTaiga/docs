# Data Filtration

Understanding your data's characteristics is a key aspect of data analysis and preparation. The "Statistics" section provides tools for data analysis, computation of statistical metrics, and data visualization. We also offer a specialized data analysis application, making the process more intuitive and informative.

## Example apps:
* [Filter images.](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/apps/filter-images?id=187) App filters images from a project and allows you to copy, move, delete images and assign or remove tags.
* [Prompt-based Image Filtering with CLIP.](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/apps/prompt-based-image-filtering?id=249)
This app allows you to quickly and easily filter and rank images in Supervisely datasets by text prompts. It uses CLIP model to predict the relevance of images to the given text prompt. This app can be useful for filtering or ranking images in a dataset by their content. The relevance (CLIP score) of each image to the given prompt will be shown in a table. The user can choose to filter or sort images by relevance or do both at the same time and then upload images to a new dataset.
