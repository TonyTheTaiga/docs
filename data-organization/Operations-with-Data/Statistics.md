# Statistics

Understanding your data's characteristics is a key aspect of data analysis and preparation. The "Statistics" section provides tools for data analysis, computation of statistical metrics, and data visualization. We also offer a specialized data analysis application, making the process more intuitive and informative.

## Example apps:
* [Classes stats for images.](https://app.supervisely.com/ecosystem/apps/classes-stats-for-images?id=16) Data Exploration for Segmentation and Detection tasks is underestimated by many researchers. The accuracy of your models highly depends on how good you understand data.
