# Import using Team Files.

In fact, when you drag and drop your files into the upload window, we upload them to an automatically created folder in Team Files, launch the application of choice, passing in the path to that folder, and then automatically delete it.

Sometimes if you have a lot of files or you want to upload files via the API, and then set an application on them or you launched an application that uploaded the dataset to team files, but this is not a project yet. Then, download files or folders using drag, or get them there in another way above - select the appropriate application from the context menu and enjoy.
