# Import using Team Files.

In fact, when you drag and drop your files into the upload window, we upload them to an automatically created folder in Team Files, launch the application of choice, passing in the path to that folder, and then automatically delete it.

 Sometimes, you have too many files to upload via drag-and-drop. Or, you may want to upload files via the API first, and then run a Supervisely App on those files. Or, maybe, you launched a Supervisely App that generated a new project, saved it to  your [team files](../../team-files/README.md), but those files are not a project yet. In that case, you can just select the appropriate Supervisely App from the context menu of a folder in your [Team Files](../../team-files/README.md) â€” and enjoy.
