# Overview

The "Data Organization" section delves into the methodology of data management, which is a vital component of our system. We aim to ensure efficient data storage and management while considering the following crucial aspects ☝️

## 🔀 Data Deduplication:
Data deduplication is the process of eliminating redundant information. We actively apply this technique to reduce the volume of stored data, optimize system performance, and remove duplicates, enhancing data cleanliness and storage efficiency. It's important to note that while we have the capability to remove duplicates, it is not a mandatory requirement, offering flexibility in data management.

## ☁️ Cloud Resources:
Our system provides the capability to use cloud storage for more effective and reliable data storage. This allows us to scale our storage when needed and facilitates the uploading and downloading of data from and to cloud services. Thus, we offer flexibility and data accessibility from anywhere in the world.

## 🗄️ [Data Storage](storage\README.md):
All our data is stored in a specialized hard drive, which ensures its safety and availability. We pay special attention to data management to ensure the safety and integrity of your information.
