The image labeling toolbox allows you to annotate one image at a time, such as .jpg, .png, .tiff, and many more formats you can [import](../../data-organization/import/import/import.md) to Supervisely.



## Classic vs Version 2.0
We have two versions of the image labeling toolbox: the time proven classic version and itâ€™s successor: the most advanced image labeling toolbox 2.0. By default, we suggest annotating the version 2.0 which has much more functionality and provides better performance and only consider the classic version in case you have a valid reason for that, such as your team got used to it and loves it so much ðŸ™‚
