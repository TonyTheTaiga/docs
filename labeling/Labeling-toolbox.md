# Overview

 With more than 5 years of constant improvement, proved by hundreds of businesses, Supervisely provides a complete set of labeling toolboxes for various modalities and tasks, starting from images, videos, and including even solutions for 3D point clouds and volumetric data.

## Pre-Requirements

Follow those recommendations for the best results:

{% hint style="info" %}
Though we support all common web browsers, we strongly recommend using **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox**, because we use latest technologies to render annotations. We also advise you to use the latest version of web browser.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To work with large images and lots of annotations we recommend to use computer with hardware acceleration available. Check if your browser uses hardware acceleration [here](chrome://gpu).
{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

First, [import](../data-organization/import/import/import.md) the dataset you would like to annotate. You can upload images, videos, and many other types of data from your computer or import one of our [sample projects](https://ecosystem.supervisely.com/import+images+project) from the Ecosystem.

To open the labeling toolbox, go to the [Projects](../data-organization/project/projects.md) page, select one of the projects and click on a dataset. Depending on the type of your project, you will see a popup where you can select the right toolbox or, if there is one, the labeling toolbox will open automatically.

When opening a labeling toolbox, you can only annotate a single dataset at a time.

You can also open the labeling toolbox from a [Labeling Job](jobs/README.md) or the [Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.supervisely.com/annotation_tools/image-labeling-tool-v2) page.
