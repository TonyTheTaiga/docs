## **Label video, not just bunch of images**
Apart from many other labeling software, Supervisely lets you work with your video files without cropping them into images first.

To archive this, we designed a video player, capable of handling hours-long videos, yet precisely switching between individual frames right in your web browser.

24 FPS √ó 60 SECS √ó 60 MINS = 86,400 FRAMES IN 1H

A single one-hour video contains about a hundred thousand frames. Cutting such a video into individual images has countless disadvantages, comparing to our approach:

**Supervisely video toolbox**
- üëç  No conversion
Start annotation immediately after uploading or just connect your existing cloud storage and access any of your videos.

- üëç  Playback at real or even 20x speed
Navigating on your video is as fast as in your desktop player. Quickly check labeling quality or navigate easy.

- üëç  No manual managing of tracking IDs
Built from scratch, Supervisely has annotation objects that can contain multiple instances from different frames.

- üëç  Nothing is lost in translation
Having full set of frames, you can precisely track or tag objects on long segments and be sure your neural network will train on the same picture your labelers has annotated.


## **Timeline panel keeps you focused on labeling, not roaming around frames**

It‚Äôs easy to get frustrated with thousands of frames and objects labeled.

Video timeline panel provides overall structure, answers questions like what is already labeled and simplifies editing tag segments and tracked objects.
