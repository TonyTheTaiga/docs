## **Label video, not just bunch of images**

Apart from many other labeling software, Supervisely lets you work with your video files without cropping them into images first.

To archive this, we designed a video player, capable of handling hours-long videos, yet precisely switching between individual frames right in your web browser.


## **Timeline panel keeps you focused on labeling, not roaming around frames**

Itâ€™s easy to get frustrated with thousands of frames and objects labeled.

Video timeline panel provides overall structure, answers questions like what is already labeled and simplifies editing tag segments and tracked objects.
