Our [toolbox for 3D Point Cloud labeling](3D-Point-Clouds.md) is a great solution for annotation a single point cloud at a time. But if you need to label a series of point clouds, we have a dedicated toolbox for that called 3D Point Clouds Episodes.

## **Point cloud episodes**
Just like as specially designed [video labeling toolbox](../videos/README.md) is remarkably more performant than annotation of separate frames in [image toolbox](../images/README.md), specially designed 3D episodes toolbox is surpassingly more excellent in every aspect from playback speed to tracking performance.

## **Timeline panel is your multi-purpose navigation guide**
Itâ€™s easy to get frustrated with hundreds of clouds and objects labeled.

Episode timeline panel provides overall structure, answers questions like what is already labeled and simplifies editing tag segments and tracked objects.
