# Labeling Consensus


Consensus labeling is an annotation approach when multiple annotators collaboratively label the same set of images independently and the resulting annotation is based on combining labels with one of the consensus algorithms like, for example, the well-known majority voting. This approach is not limited to specific computer vision tasks and can be used for object detection, semantic and instance segmentation, classification and others.
