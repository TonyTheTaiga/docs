# Labeling Jobs

Labeling Jobs allow assigning annotation tasks to labelers.

While you can call annotation interface directly from the Projects page, there are some difficulties you may face:

- Job management - the need to describe a particular task: what kind of objects to annotate and how
- Progress monitoring - tracking annotation status and reviewing submitted results
- Access permissions - limiting access only to specific datasets and classes within a single job

You can see a detailed example in the blog
