# Labeling Jobs
Labeling jobs is a powerful tool for efficiently organizing and distributing data annotation tasks within a team. It is designed to ensure that annotators work on well-defined and manageable portions of the dataset, follow consistent guidelines, and contribute to the overall success of the annotation project while maintaining data quality and accuracy. It is a critical component of effective team coordination in data annotation efforts.

Labeling Jobs allow assigning annotation tasks to labelers.
While you can call annotation interface directly from the Projects page, there are some difficulties you may face:
- Job management - the need to describe a particular task: what kind of objects to annotate and how
- Progress monitoring - tracking annotation status and reviewing submitted results
- Access permissions - limiting access only to specific datasets and classes within a single job
