# Labeling Jobs
Labeling jobs is a powerful tool for efficiently organizing and distributing data annotation tasks within a [team](../../collaboration/teams.md). It is designed to ensure that annotators work on well-defined and manageable portions of the [dataset](../../data-organization/project/datasets/datasets.md), follow consistent guidelines, and contribute to the overall success of the annotation project while maintaining data quality and accuracy. It is a critical component of effective team coordination in data annotation efforts.

One of the components of this tool is [queues](Labeling-Queues.md). Queues allow you to divide annotation tasks into individual parts, which are then distributed among annotators based on their availability and skills. This provides a more even distribution of the workload and speeds up the annotation process, which is especially important when working with large data sets.

Queues also help with deadlines and team coordination by allowing you to track progress and distribute tasks. This makes Labeling Tasks an integral part of effective team collaboration when working on data annotation.
