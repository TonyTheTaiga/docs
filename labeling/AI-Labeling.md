## **SMART TOOL**
### AI-assisted magic wand
Manual segmentation of a complex shape can be ridiculously time-consuming. Our tool uses AI to produce high quality results with lower cost.

## Designed for any object
Smart tool is class-agnostic — it was not trained to capture specific objects, but rather any forms that stand out.

## Customizable it to work on your data
What’s great about the neural network in the core of the smart tool is that it can be re-trained to better fit your very unique case and produce unprecedented results with just a little bit of extra data.

|Neural network in the heart of the smart tool never saw a human — it fails to produce great segmentation at first.|Label a few examples of objects smart tool needs to predict better and run automated re-train application.|Now smart tool has re-trained and uses updated neural network that knows how humans look — and it produces precise segmentation.|


## Even better results with Ecosystem
The core technology behind the Smart Tools is stunning — but it becomes an absolute deal-breaker when we deploy the Smart Tool as part of our Ecosystem. Now, other Supervisely Apps can communicate with it and can build more complex solution, such as this Batch Smart Tools application:

## Images, videos, 3D, medical — it's on!
Another substantial thing about neural networks is that it's easy to adapt it to different modalities. That means, that the Smart Tools not only work on images, but on sequential frames, such as videos or multi-slice medial imaging and even 3D point clouds with more than two dimensions!

| No need to trade speed for quality — smart tool can produce prediction almost immediately in response to your input!    | While crucially increasing labeling speed on images, smart tool is priceless in segmentation of videos, DICOMs and 3D point clouds.   | In many cases smart tool can outperform human labeler not only in terms of speed, but also produce quality beyond human capabilities.   |
