History panel lists operations performed in the current session on a current image.

You can undo or redo incorrect actions by clicking on correct state of an image or using `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` shortcuts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We save history of changes only for a current image. If you change current image, history panel will clear and you will not be able to redo recent actions.
{% endhint %}
