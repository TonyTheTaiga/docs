# ðŸ¤– What's Supervisely

**Supervisely** is computer vision platform for researchers and companies to annotate and manage datasets, train neural networks and much more.

Unlike other platforms, Supervisely is [built like OS](./ecosystem/ecosystem.md): instead of having a huge monolith, Supervisely creates a foundation for developing and running applications called Supervisely Apps.

Supervisely is available [online](https://app.supervisely.com/signup) for free, as well as an on-premise edition for enterprises.
